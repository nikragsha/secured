    <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Why should I use a password generator?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Using a password generator ensures that your passwords are strong and difficult to guess, enhancing the security of your online accounts.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How does a password generator work?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A password generator creates random and complex combinations of characters, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special symbols to generate strong passwords.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How do I remember these complex passwords?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Consider using a reputable password manager to securely store and manage your passwords. You only need to remember one master password for the manager.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Can I use the same password for multiple accounts?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>It's not recommended to use the same password across multiple accounts. Using a unique password for each account reduces the risk of a security breach affecting multiple services.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What's the recommended password length?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A password should ideally be at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are generally more secure.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Are the generated passwords resistant to hacking attempts?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>While no password can be guaranteed to be completely hack-proof, the strong and random nature of the passwords generated makes them highly resistant to most hacking attempts.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How often should I change my passwords?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>It's a good practice to change your passwords periodically, especially for critical accounts. Many experts recommend changing passwords every 3 to 6 months.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Can I use password patterns or sequences?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>It's best to avoid using easily recognizable patterns or sequences, as they can be easier for attackers to crack. Randomness is key to password strength.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What if I suspect my current passwords have been compromised?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If you suspect a security breach, it's essential to change your passwords immediately. Our password generator can help you create strong replacement passwords.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A secure password is one that is long, complex, and contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. It should be difficult to guess or crack using automated tools.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Should I use personal information in my passwords?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
